Prompted by a colleague, I created a high-resolution version of the Cosmic Microwave Background map in MollWeide projection released by the Planck collaboration, available on the [Planck Data Release Website](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release_1/all-sky-maps/previews/COM_CompMap_CMB-smica_2048_R1.20/index.html) in FITS format.

The grayed out pixels in the galactic plane represents the fraction of the sky that is not possible to reconstruct due to bright galactic sources.

The map is a PNG at a resolution of 17469x8796 pixels, which is suitable for printing at 300dpi up to 60x40 inch, or 150x100 cm, file size is about 150MB.
